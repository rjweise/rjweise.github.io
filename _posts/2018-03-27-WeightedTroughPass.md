## Weighted through passes in hockey

Not by coincidence probably, here is another smart play from last nights game by the Lightning. Unfortunately the opportunity was not recognized to finish it off with a great goal scoring opportunity, but I love the play itself. So common in soccer, I don't see this kind of weighted through pass that often in hockey (probably as it seems much harder to do on a smaller and frozen surface) but when I do it gives me pure enjoyment, even if it ends with a shot from a crowded spot that doesn't get through with a man wide-open on the highway of goal-scoring heaven:
