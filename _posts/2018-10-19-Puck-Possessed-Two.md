## Puck Possessed two is a re-post of a visual I posted in Twitter about a month ago, looking at shot attempts split by their results.

Here's a look at puck possession expressed in shot attempts, and goal differential

Here is a [link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rj7974#!/vizhome/NHL20172018_ShotByType_Analysis/PuckPossessed2?publish=yes) to the interactive Tableau visual, where you can change the team to update the graphs to their stats. You can also save the visal as a pdf or image.
